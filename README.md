Tripvillas is one of Asia's largest Holiday Home Rental Companies. The company was founded in late 2009 by Roshan D'Silva when looking for ways to generate additional income from Coffee Plantations owned by his family in India. 
Over the years, Tripvillas has grown to add to it's core rental business other key businesses to serve the Holiday Home industry in Asia. These include a Software business, a Vacation Community Management Business, Property Management including brokerage and Interiors of Vacation Homes, Branded development of Vacation Communities and an Exchange Program where Holiday Home owners can exchange their unsold nights with other Owners.
